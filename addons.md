There's a long list of addons on the server, but on this site we'll just highlight the important ones.
==- Napf Extended
The map used is called Napf (Chernarus), and here we've gone ahead and made custom cities, as well as custom traders - therefore we call it "*Napf Extended*".
==-
==- Wicked AI
Enhances the game's Artificial Intelligence (AI) for non-player characters (NPCs). It typically makes the AI more challenging and intelligent, often by improving their combat tactics, decision-making, and overall behavior.
==-
==- Convoys
Adds convoys around the map on different roads, which consists of AI-controlled vehicles, with at least a couple of bandits, moving from one location to another.   
The reward for downing such a convoy might not seem so great, but is a great way to qucikly grab some new guns and a quick buck.
==-
==- DayZ Mission System (DZMS)
Adds a ton of different missions across Chernarus, for the players to engage with and earn humanity and a ton of loot.

We go further down into the specifics over at the [missions](/missions) page.
==-
==- Vehicle Key Changer
Adds a way to change the key used for vehicles.   

This can be used to have loads of different vehicles on one key, to prevent the players having a bad time when trying to find the right key.   

You'll need a Keymakers Kit, as well as two keys - one of the keys is for the vehicle you want to move to another key, and the other one is the key you want to move it to.   
When trying to interact with a vehicle, you can select "*Change Vehicle Key*" and pick the key you want to move the vehicle to.
==-
==- Door/Safe Code Changer
Adds a way to add a custom code for safes/lockboxes/doors when placed and allow changing of codes.
==-
==- Home Base Elevators
Adds an elevator to the game, that you can use in your bases.
==-
==- Valuable Hunting & Fishing
Tired of Hunting and Fishing being dead? Fear no more, we've corrected prices for the typical hunting supplies, that should hopefully give you the boost you needed!
==-
==- Gem/Ore Vein Hunting

Self explanatory...

==- Gambling Arcade Machine

Why waste your precious time going on missions, when you could just run the slots, and make dozens of coins?

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. **Install Retype**: Ensure you have Retype installed on your machine to preview changes locally. See [Retype documentation](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/) for installation instructions.

## Making Contributions
### Editing Content

2. **Edit Using Markdown**: Make your changes using Markdown syntax. Refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) if you're unfamiliar with it.
3. **Preview Your Changes**: Use Retype to build the site locally and preview your changes.

### Adding New Content

2. **Push to GitHub**: Push the changes to your fork on GitHub.
3. **Create a Pull Request**: From your fork, submit a pull request to the [original repository](https://github.com/LovelessCodes/msgzwiki/).

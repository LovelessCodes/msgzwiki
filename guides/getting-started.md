This page should get you started good on the server, and get you most of the information that you need when starting out.

==- Getting money
+++ Bandits
When you kill bandits, you can go over to them and select `Check Wallet` - they'll usually have around `500` to `10,000` coins on them.

+++ Fishing
Cooked fish sell for quite a lot - between `1,500` and `4,000` each, but before you can go fishing, you'll need a `Fishing Pole`.
+++

==- Getting a better weapon
You'll start out with a `Famas` and essentials to keep you alive.   
The `Famas` isn't the best weapon, so it's a good idea to find some way to get a better weapon with a scope.

+++ Traders
You'll start out with `10,000` Coins in your bank, but to spend them you have to get them out at an `ATM`, or fix the `Broken Phone` in your inventory with a `Portable Soldering`.   
When you've gotten the coins out, or gotten some money in your wallet - you can go to a weapon dealer and get a new weapon.

+++ Bandits
When killing bandits, you'll usually have a better weapon than a bloody `Famas`.   

If you want to go long distance on your future enemies, you'll either want to get a `Sniper Rifle`, or a weapon with an `ACOG` scope.

==- Gathering Humanity

Increasing your humanity is a key part of the gameplay. You start with a base humanity of `2,500`.
+++ Burying Bodies

!!!
You will need the tool `Entrenching Tool` to do this
!!!

Burying bodies is often a way to dispose of deceased players or NPCs, and it provides a substantial boost to your humanity score, typically granting `30` humanity points per body buried.

+++ Killing Bandits

To boost your humanity, focus on eliminating `bandits`, which are typically encountered during [missions](/missions.md). Each bandit you successfully take down will add `35` humanity to your score. Engaging in these [missions](/missions.md) not only challenges your combat skills but also strategically increases your humanity, impacting your character's standing and experience in the game. Remember, consistent participation in [missions](/missions.md) and effective elimination of `bandits` are your primary means to accumulate more humanity and progress in the game.

+++ Killing Zombies

Another way to increase your humanity is by killing zombies. For each zombie you eliminate, you will earn `5` humanity points. This means that actively engaging and defeating zombies is an in-effective method to boost your humanity.

This page should get you started good on the server, and get you most of the information that you need when starting out.

==- Getting money
+++ Bandits
When you kill bandits, you can go over to them and select `Check Wallet` - they'll usually have around `500` to `10,000` coins on them.

+++ Fishing
Cooked fish sell for quite a lot - between `1,500` and `4,000` each, but before you can go fishing, you'll need a `Fishing Pole`.
+++

==- Getting a better weapon
You'll start out with a `Famas` and essentials to keep you alive.   
The `Famas` isn't the best weapon, so it's a good idea to find some way to get a better weapon with a scope.

+++ Traders
You'll start out with `10,000` Coins in your bank, but to spend them you have to get them out at an `ATM`, or fix the `Broken Phone` in your inventory with a `Portable Soldering`.   
When you've gotten the coins out, or gotten some money in your wallet - you can go to a weapon dealer and get a new weapon.

+++ Bandits
When killing bandits, you'll usually have a better weapon than a bloody `Famas`.   

If you want to go long distance on your future enemies, you'll either want to get a `Sniper Rifle`, or a weapon with an `ACOG` scope.

This page should get you started good on the server, and get you most of the information that you need when starting out.

Let's go over the basics first.

You'll start out with a `Famas` and essentials to keep you alive.   
The `Famas` isn't the best weapon, so it's a good idea to find some way to get a better weapon with a scope.   

Bandits will usually have a better weapon (most of the time), and have a good chunk of money on them.   
When you kill bandits, you can go over to them and select `Check Wallet` - they'll usually have around `500` to `10,000` coins on them.

In your bank you'll have `10,000` coins, but to spend them you have to get them out at an `ATM`.

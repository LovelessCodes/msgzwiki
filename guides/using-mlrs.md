This guide is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to master the use of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) within  Arma 2: DayZ Epoch. The MLRS, a powerful artillery system, stands as a game-changer on the battlefield, providing unmatched firepower and strategic advantage.

## Loading ammunition
1. Have some `12Rnd. MLRS` ammunition on you, in your inventory.
2. Go into the MLRS' `Gunner's seat`.
3. Select `Add ammo to MLRS`, and you should begin loading the ammunition.

## Marking your Target
!!!
Before you do anything, be seated in the Gunner seat
!!!
1. Go into the Map, by clicking the `M` key.
2. Select a location and target it by clicking `Shift` + `Left Mousebutton`, doesn't really matter, since we'll move the target later.
3. Exit out of the map, and go to the `Artillery Computer` option in the access menu.
4. Find your target, that you put down in step 2, and move it by holding `Left Mousebutton` and dragging it.
5. Move the mark to the desired location, and you should be able to fire it, if you're on the right `Mode`.

*Which mode do I need to use?*, I hear you asking.

The thing is, there's 3 modes.
||| Semi (close)
This is within `2039` and `4652` meters.
||| Semi (medium)
This is within `4214` and `9613` meters.
||| Semi (far)
This is within `8852` and `20153` meters.

So you need to be at least `2039` meters from your target, otherwise you'll end up shooting somewhere else.

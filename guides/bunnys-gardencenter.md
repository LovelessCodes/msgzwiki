**Getting Started with `Herbs Notebook`**
- First, acquire the `Herbs Notebook`. This can be bought at [Bunny's Gardencenter](/traders/bunnys-gardencenter.md) under `Garden Specials` for `1,000,000 Coins`.
- This essential tool allows you to view craftable plant kits.
- Simply right-click on the Notebook to see your options.

**Crafting Plant Kits**
- To craft a kit, select your desired plant kit from `Herbs Notebook`. Upon selection, the required items and tools for crafting will be displayed.
- Most of the necessary items and tools can be purchased at [Bunny's Gardencenter](/traders/bunnys-gardencenter.md). However, note that `Herbal Water` is an exception.

**About `Herbal Water`**
- `Herbal Water` is a unique requirement specifically for crafting hemp.
- This item cannot be purchased - it must be either found or crafted by you.

**Managing Your Plants**
- Once you've successfully crafted a plant kit, it will appear in your inventory.
- To use the kit, right-click on it. Remember, do not select the `PATCH` option.
- To deploy a plant, choose the option: `Deploy plant`.
- Ensure you are within the boundary of your plot pole to deploy plants.
- Be strategic about where you place your plants. Some cannot be repacked or removed, even with admin powers.
- Consider the accessibility of your plants to other players - they can harvest your plants if they get close enough.
